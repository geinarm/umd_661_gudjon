\section{} %1

They are probabilistically complete, i.e the probability of finding a solution if one exists approaches $1$ as runtime approaches $\infty$


\section{} %2

They are asymptotically optimal, i.e the solution approaches the optimal solution as runtime approaches $\infty$


\section{} %3

When the environment is likely to change from one moment to the next, e.g mobile robots, robots in dynamic environments.


\section{} %4

When the robot is fixed in place, the workspace is well defined and unlikely to change.


\section{} %5

RRT, RRT*, RRT\#. PRM is not well suited for problems where we cannot solve the two-point boundary value problem.
